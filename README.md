# sagerbingo
A python module to play Sager Bingo during Unsupervised Learning and Time Series Analysis!

The module creates an object called Board. Board has several attributes and methods but the main onces you need to know are .board, .square_options, .shuffle(), .X(col,row) and .un_X(col,row).

See the example IPython notebook and feel free to use that notebook to play today. Let me know of any you run into as you go!
